## Great decisions are made when the choices are clear. We help your organization remove the clutter to see a clear picture..

Data comes from everywhere these days, from government and vendor websites to your customers and the general public. When you get your hands on it, it’s often disappointing to find you can’t open the files because their too large, or are in a format that is hard to use.

We help organizations structure that data into meaningful collections, make it accessible through powerful user interface, and visualize it in ways that make sense to your audience.

### Features

The Features selection of the Data Visualization page should contain 4 slides containing details on Maps, Charts, Reports, and Custom. Each slide should cover one of those four topics as it applies to Data Visualization, a sentence at most describing how it is used, and an image showing a real world example of the 4 visualization elements.

#### Maps

#### Charts

#### Reports

#### Custom

### Technology

### Examples

We should have 2-4 examples for this. The content should appear in blocks and each one should focus on a specific application of the type of visuzalization. For example, Maps could be the BlueWaterBaltimore home page, Charts could be the Ashtracker station page, Reports could be the NFWF metrics, and Custom could be the FPW Grants single page.

Each of those should link to a specific Partner Case Study page (e.g., HarborAlert, Ashtracker, Foundation PA Watersheds, NFWF).
